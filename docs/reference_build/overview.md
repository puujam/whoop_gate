# Reference Build
This documents the build originally created by the author for this project. It can be used for reference if you are looking to create your own build.

It is verly likely the costs of this build can be reduced as much of the hardware is more powerful than necessary and/or includes a wide margin of reliability for things like power. This was chosen to minimize risk and maximize lifespan on my original build.

## Bill of Materials
